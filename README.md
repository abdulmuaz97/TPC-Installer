# TPC-Installer
Simple python script to execute the terminal commands..based on Python3 but it works on python2 too.

# Download command in terminal: git clone https://github.com/abdulmuaz97/TPC-Installer.git

# How to use:
- First open terminal in the TPC-Installer.py location.
- Create a text file called 'File.txt' or whatever you call.
- Write your commands in the File.txt and be advised that this symbol '#' means a comment which is not readable in the file and this symbol '>' means a terminal command and it's a readable one...each line in File.txt contains this '>' will be read.
- Type in terminal this: python3 TPC-Installer.py File.txt
- Standby and commands will be executed as well.

# Enjoy.
